    dct:description           "The vocabulary collection is maintained by the LOV team of curators in charge of validating and inserting vocabularies in the LOV data base and assigning them a detailed review (updated on a yearly basis). Before a vocabulary is inserted, LOV team contacts the authors to make sure the vocabulary is published following the best practices and meets quality requirements of the overall LOV ecosystem. When some metadata failed to be extracted automatically (such as creators of a vocabulary), curators try to add them manually by harvesting information from the documentation or from direct communication with the publisher. Once included, an automatic script checks for vocabulary updates on a daily basis. The documentation assists any user in the task of understanding the semantics of each vocabulary term and therefore of any data using it. For instance, information about the creator and publisher is a key indication in case help or clarification is required, or to assess the stability of that artifact. About 55% of vocabularies specify at least one creator, contributor or editor. We augment this information using manually gathered information, leading to inclusion of data about the creator in over 85% of vocabularies in LOV. The database stores each version of a vocabulary over time since its first available issue. For each version, LOV stores a file backup on its server, even if the original files are no longer available from their original source. To embrace the complexity of the vocabulary ecosystem and assess the impact of a modification, one needs to know in which vocabularies and datasets a particular vocabulary term is referenced. LOV provides a unique entry point to such information.";

    dct:description           """A service built on sharing
Research Vocabularies Australia helps you find, access, and reuse vocabularies for research. Some vocabularies are hosted by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and can be accessed directly through Research Vocabularies Australia. Otherwise Research Vocabularies Australia provides a link to the vocabulary ownerâ€™s web page.

Research Vocabularies Australia also allows you to create and/or publish a vocabulary as well as integrate an existing vocabulary into your own system.

Vocabularies for the research community
Research Vocabularies Australia caters for researchers and those who support, describe and discover research, including vocabulary managers, ontologists, data managers and librarians.

Through engagement with the research community, Research Vocabularies Australia will grow to cover a broad spectrum of research fields - across sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities. Many of the vocabularies you can discover here are immediately accessible, either directly through Research Vocabularies Australia or via partners and publishers, and are free to use (subject to licence conditions).

For more background information on this service see https://ardc.edu.au/services/research-vocabularies-australia/.
